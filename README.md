# Api-Version-Fuzzer
API Version Hunter is a Burp Suite extension designed to automatically identify and fuzz versioned API endpoints. It helps penetration testers and bug bounty hunters discover undocumented or older API versions (e.g., v1, v2, v3) that may lack security controls present in the current version.
